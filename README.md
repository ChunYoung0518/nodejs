# nodejs
Non blocking is the key improvement.
The key of nodejs is the modules and callbacks.
Does nodejs looks quite 'casual' to me comparing to java.

cons:
Does not check the variable type like java does, sometimes runs into runtime error.
The IDE does not have auto complet like IntelliJ does, will need to complet the brackets manually. Maybe check some plug-ins?
