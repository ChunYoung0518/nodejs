# nodejs
Non blocking is the key improvement.

The key of nodejs is the modules and callbacks.

Nodejs looks quite 'casual' to me comparing to java.

Knows: Variables(const, let, var); Fuctions; Callbacks, () => {}; {destructuring}.

cons:
Does not check the variable type like java does, sometimes runs into runtime error.

The IDE does not have auto complete like IntelliJ does, will need to complete the brackets of a method manually. Also, sometime imports the wrong requires. Maybe check some plug-ins?
